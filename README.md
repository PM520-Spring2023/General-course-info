# General Course Info

*Syllabus and course slides are posted on blackboard webpage*

We are going to be using github to manage up/download of exercises and assignments. We encourage the use of R as a coding language for this course. Some details of how to install R and github can be found below. Please install these before the first class if you can. If you run into any problems, we can help you with them at the start of class.

1. The home page for the R project is: http://www.r-project.org/
Please follow the link downloadR in the box Getting Started.
Then download and install the most recent release.
Older machines might require an older version.

2. We will be running R using the R Studio integrated development environment (IDE).
Please download and install RStudio Desktop Open Source License from the following
website: http://www.rstudio.com/

3. Please create a GitHub account at https://github.com if you do not have one.

4. You will need the software Git to talk between GitHub and RStudio. Please install Git
from https://git-scm.com/downloads. Now you will need to set your Git username and email.
Do this by opening a Terminal (cmd) Window and typing (using "Mona Lisa" as an example username):
    
    >git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
    
    confirm that the user name is set by typing
    >git config --global user.name
    >Mona Lisa
    
    Setting the email is very similar. Do this by typing
    
    >git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
    
    And confirm that you have set the email address by typing:
    >git config --global user.email
    >email@example.com
    
    Directions to follow are found here, under Setting up Git:

In-class exercises and examinable assignments will be posted here. The best way to access them will be via invites you will receive from Github classroom. (If you do it that way it will automatically set up your repositories and make them available to the instructor for feedback and grading when you are ready.)

In order to access the exercise/assignment details, pseudocode, etc., and then be able to push your solutions so that I can see them, you need to accept the invitation you will receive via email for each exercise.

When you start work on an exercises or assignment, you will need to complete the following steps:

1. Accept the invitation to the assignment that you will receive by email.

2. Link the assignment to your Github ID (github will automatically ask you to do this and help you get it done).

3. Downoad the pseudocode (if there is any for that problem). The simplest way to do this using RStudio is shown in the "Hello World" exercise that we will be doing at the start of class on Week 1.

4. As you are working on the problem, regularly "commit" your work. I will not be able to see what you are doing, and comment on it, until you "push" the work back to Github. Get into the habit of committing regularly. 

5. Once you have completed your work on that problem you need to "commit" you work and then push it to github one final time. Once you have done this, please create an issue in that repository and type a message to let me know that you have uploaded your work. Please include my ID (@pmarjora) in your issue text so that Github will notify me that it is ready for me to look at.
